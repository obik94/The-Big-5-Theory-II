			<h1>The Factors</h1>
			
			As it has been already said, the five-factor model of personality (FFM) is a set of five broad trait 
			dimensions or domains, often referred to as the “Big Five”: Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, 
			Neuroticism (sometimes named by its polar opposite, Emotional Stability), and Openness to Experience 
			(sometimes named Intellect)<sub>[16, 17, 18]</sub>:
			
			<table id="table1">
       
    <tr>
    <th>Opennes to Experience</th>
    <td>This trait features characteristics such as imagination and insight, and those high in this trait also tend to have a broad range of interests. 
Openness is a general appreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unusual ideas, imagination, curiosity, and variety of experience
</td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Conscientiousness</th>
    <td>Standard features of this dimension include high levels of thoughtfulness, with good impulse control and goal-directed behaviors. 
Conscientiousness is a tendency to show self-discipline, act dutifully, and aim for achievement against measures or outside expectations. 
</td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Extraversion</th>
    <td>Extraversion is characterized by excitability, sociability, talkativeness, assertiveness and high amounts of emotional expressiveness
Extraverts enjoy being with people, are full of energy, and often experience positive emotions. 
Introverts have lower social engagement and energy levels than extraverts. 
</td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Agreeblenes</th>
    <td>This personality dimension includes attributes such as trust, altruism, kindness, affection and other prosocial behaviors. 
Agreeable individuals value getting along with others. Disagreeable individuals place self-interest above getting along with others. </td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Neuroticism</th>
    <td>Neuroticism is the tendency to experience negative emotions, such as anger, anxiety, or depression.
T
hose who score high in neuroticism are emotionally reactive and vulnerable to stress. 
At the other end of the scale, individuals who score low in Neuroticism are less easily upset and are less emotionally reactive. They tend to be calm, emotionally stable, and free from persistent negative feelings.
