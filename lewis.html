		<h1>Lewis Goldberg </h1>
		
		<p>Lewis Goldberg is an American personality psychologist. He is well-known for his Big Five personality 
		traits. He was born on June 23, 1932, in Chicago, Illinois. He was one of the 
		contributors to the scientific literature in Personality and Psychological 
		Assessment. He continues to research on the effects of personality traits 
		on health and the structure of personality traits and the role that they play.<sub>[12]</sub> <br> <br>
During Goldberg’s childhood, a lot was going on in the world. Goldberg grew up facing many 
economic and emotional difficulties due to the great depression and the war. Psychology was 
something new during the time period. Radio psychology became common. This all led up to Goldberg’s
 Big Five Personality Traits model that was created to assess one’s personality and psyche.<sub>[13]</sub> <br> <br>
There were many critiques regarding this theory. Critics believed that these types
 of standardized personality tests capture only a part of an individual’s personality. 
 The Big Five theory is still used today by many psychologists to gain a better understanding 
 of personality disorders. It is also common in the workplace for recruitment and candidate assessment.<sub>[14]</sub><br> <br>
Goldberg’s Five Life lessons<sub>[15]</sub>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lesson No. 1: Send everything that you write to everyone you know (and ask for their help).</li>
<li>Lesson No. 2: Don’t be afraid to pick up what’s been dropped by others.</li>
<li>Lesson No. 3: Don’t be afraid to go away and then to stay away a long time.</li>
<li>Lesson No. 4: Remember good ideas – they can be useful in the future.</li>
<li>Lesson No. 5: Shave your head, stay healthy, and outlive the competition.</li>
</ul>
