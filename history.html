		<h1>History and Development</h1>
			
			
			<p>During many years, this theory was widely examined.</p>
		
		<h2>Origins</h2>
<p> In 1936 Gordon Allport and H. S. Odbert hypothesized that: </p> <br>
<p id="cit">  Those individual differences that are most salient and socially relevant in people’s lives will eventually 
become encoded into their language; the more important such a difference, the more likely is it to become expressed
 as a single word. </p> <br>
<p> This statement has become known as the Lexical Hypothesis. <sub>[6]</sub>
Allport and Odbert had worked through two of the most comprehensive dictionaries of the English language available at 
the time, and extracted 18,000 personality-describing words. From this gigantic list they extracted 4500 personality-describing 
adjectives which they considered to describe observable and relatively permanent traits.<sub>[7]</sub> <br> <br>
In 1946 Raymond Cattell used the emerging technology of computers to analyse the Allport-Odbert list. 
He organized the list into 181 clusters and asked subjects to rate people whom they knew by the adjectives on the list. 
Using factor analysis Cattell generated twelve factors, and then included four factors which he thought ought to appear. 
The result was the hypothesis that individuals describe themselves and each other according to sixteen different, independent factors.<sub>[8]</sub> </p>
<h2> Hiatus in Research </h2>
<p>For the next seventeen years, the changing Zeitgeist (<i>aka</i><sub>[9]</sub>  spirit of the age or spirit of the time) made the publication 
of personality research difficult. Social psychologists argued that behavior is not stable, but varies with context, so that 
predicting behavior by personality test was impossible. They further argued that character, or personality, is something humans 
impose on people in order to maintain an illusion of consistency in the world. Furthermore, Walter Mischel in his 1968 book 
Psychological Assessment asserted that personality tests could not predict behavior with a correlation of more than 0.3.<sub>[10]</sub><br> <br>

Around 1980, three developments brought personality research into the modern era: personal computers, statistical aggregation, and the Big Five.<sub>[11]</sub>:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Personal computers</b><br>
Because of the invention of PCs, it was very easy to re-examine 
the Allport-Odbert list almost for anybody. The question remained as to why they 
would do so, given that it had seemingly already been established that personality was an illusion.</li>
<li> <b>Statistical aggregation</b><br>
Amongst personality psychologist, it was said that behavior was unreliable,
 therefore the researchers tried to predict the patterns of behavior. As a result 
 correlations soared from .3 to .8 and it seemed that “personality” did in fact exist. </li>
<li><b>The Big Five</b><br>
In 1981 in a symposium in Honolulu, four prominent researchers (Lewis Goldberg, Naomi Takamoto-Chock, Andrew Comrey, and John M. Digman) 
reviewed the available personality tests of the day, and decided that most of the tests 
which held any promise seemed to measure a subset of five common factors.</li>
</ul>
