			<h1>The Big Five Theory of Personality Traits</h1>
			
			<p> The Big Five personality traits, also known as the five factor model (FFM), is a model based on common language descriptors of personality.<sub>[1]</sub> <br> <br>
A trait is a temporally stable, cross-situational individual difference. Currently the most popular approach among psychologists for studying personality traits is the five-factor model or Big Five dimensions of personality. The five factors were derived from factor analyses of a large number of self- and peer reports on personality-relevant adjectives and questionnaire items.<sub>[2]</sub> <br> <br>
The Big Five theory of personality posits that human personality can be broken down into five broad traits, or "dimensions": openness, conscientiousness, agreeableness, extraversion/introversion, and neuroticism (more easily remembered by invoking the acronym OCEAN or CANOE).<sub>[3]</sub>  <br> <br>
A competing model with three dimensions based on psychophysiology is the PEN Model (extraversion, neuroticism, psychoticism).<sub>[4]</sub> <br> <br>
The HEXACO model of personality structure is a six-dimensional model of human personality that was created by Ashton and Lee based on findings from a series of lexical studies involving several European and Asian languages. The six factors, or dimensions, include Honesty-Humility (H), Emotionality (E), Extraversion (X), Agreeableness (A), Conscientiousness (C), and Openness to Experience (O).<sub>[5]</sub>
